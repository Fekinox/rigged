# ROLEPLAY SYSTEMERINO

D20 BABEY.

working titles: Rigged 

So the gist of this system is, the DM is a perverted asshole who's locked a bunch of poor bastards inside a VR universe. Once the players find a special key, they will be free to escape. That is, *if* the DM plans on letting them leave...

The players all come from all manner of multiverses, and each has their own history. This will give each character a specific 'goal' to pursue along with the main adventure- maybe learn about this new VR world, maybe screw over all their comrades, who knows. Pursuing a character's goal will give a slight boost to their stats. However, characters also have specific flaws that can hamper their Willpower when messed with.

Just for the record, RO x is just a shorthand for "test by rolling a D20. If it's greater than (NOT EQUAL TO) x, then it's good."

## CHARACTER BUILDING

So obviously you wanna build your character. Sure. Here's how.

### BASE STATS

Each character has six base stats that determine how well they perform their actions. Pretty standard stuff, yeah.

Stats have three main effects: Passive, Major, and Minor.
* Passive effects are little bonuses that boosting that stat provides.
* Major effects lower the roll-over number when performing actions.
* Minor effects add a modifier to actions.

* STR (Strength)
    * Passive: Increases amount of weight player can carry.
    * Major: Melee attacks and bare fists.
    * Minor: Boosts power of moves.

* SPD (Speed)
    * Passive: Higher Speed places you first in the turn order.
    * Major: Stealth, fleeing, confusion-type moves.
    * Minor: Boosts priority of moves.

* DEF (Defense)
    * Passive: Stun resistance.
    * Major: Parries and blocks.
    * Minor: Temporary defense boosts.

* VIT (Vitality)
    * Passive: Ailment resistance.
    * Major: Healing other players.
    * Minor: Minor health restoration.

* INT (Intelligence)
    * Passive: Elemental resistance.
    * Major: Elemental attacks and magic moves.
    * Minor: Elemental infusion.

* DRV (Drive)
    * Passive: Increases willpower.
    * Major: Ranged attacks.
    * Minor: Low chance to hit, but very powerful.

### HEALTH

All characters start off with 10 health, plus the VIT stat.

### VIM

All characters start off with 0 VP. VP can be replenished with items or by using INT-INT (Charge)

### GEAR

All starter characters start with the following equipment:

* Backpack
  Holds up to 5 items, reducing the weight of each item by 1.
  WEIGHT: +1

    * No weapon.
    * Basic Sword

### COMBAT SKILLS AND PERKS

In combat, players can use 36 different skills against their foes. However to make things less confusing, players are restricted to a small subset of these skills at any given time. Well, until later in the game, at least...

All players have the STR-STR, SPD-SPD, DEF-DEF, etc. skills automatically. But they can choose 5 skills to learn and add to their repertoire. Instead of investing in skills, they can also use those points to invest in special perks.

* **Specialist:** +2 to a weapon class of player's choice.
* **Recyclist:** RO 18 to recover used Consumable-class items.
* **Lichen:** Every other turn, RO 5 to recover 1 HP.
* **Spammer:** Every other turn, RO 5 to gain 1 VP.
* **Pinch:** +2 to a stat of player's choice when at critical health.

### ELEMENTAL AFFINITY

All characters have their affinity. It's your standard elemental rock paper scissors fare. Elemental attacks deal +2 damage against types it is strong against, and -2 damage against types it is weak against.

* **FIRE** is strong against **ICE**. RO 16 to inflict **BURN**.
* **ICE** is strong against **WIND**. RO 16 to inflict **FREEZE**.
* **WIND** is strong against **FIRE**. RO 16 to inflict **WINDED**.
* **NORMAL** is neither weak nor strong against any types. Cannot deal damage to **VOID** types.
* **VOID** is immune to **NORMAL** and both deals and receives double damage from **FIRE**, **ICE**, and **WIND** types. **VOID** is exclusive to NPCs.

### GOALS

Along with the main quest of grabbing the Key and going, there's other stuff to do in this world. Once your character arrives, they'll also have a GOAL they want to accomplish along with their main quest. The DM, being a creepy bastard, is well aware of this, and will reward those who pursue their goals.

### FLAWS

However, all characters do have their fatal flaws. If a character enters a situation that triggers their Flaw, then their willpower will lower!

### WILLPOWER

Willpower is the force that prevents a character from being seized by the DM. All players start off with 10 willpower, plus the DRV stat. Performing regular actions cost 1 willpower. Pursuing the character's goal costs 0 willpower, and being in a situation that triggers a flaw will cost 2 willpower. 

Will work on this system laterer.

## NORMAL MODE

In Normal mode, players can act in any order they wish. Each message from the DM represents a single turn passing. If the DM cannot send a message in time, the DM can announce a turn end, and then write a complete interaction from there.

## COMBAT MODE

Fights are based around turns. Turns are organized like so:

* DM announces start of turn.
* Ailments from previous turn come into effect.
* DM chooses actions for NPCs. DM must do this first because otherwise he'll have a very, very easy way to cheat.
* All player characters send actions to the DM.
* Characters execute their actions.
* Any ailments characters obtain will take effect next turn.
* End of turn.

## DECEIT MODE

Yes, NPCs have willpower too! RO 15 with an INT + DRV modifier to whittle away at an NPC's willpower.

## NATS

Inevitable. A nat 1 will result in a player losing a turn and also some willpower, and a nat 20 will double the damage/effect and boost Willpower.

## INTERRUPTS

If you encounter characters engaged in a fight, characters can burst in with an action, rolling a speed test. If they pass, they can perform the action as usual, but if they fail, they lose a turn, leaving them wide open for an enemy attack.

## ITEM MECHANICS

All items raise the relevant stat when used. So using a scope on a rifle will boost DRV when using the rifle, so on.

All items also have a special QUIRK that is unique to that item. It's usually in the item's description.

## WEIGHT

Your characters can only carry so much stuff. Backpack items can help lighten the load some.

Weight stat increases by 1 for every 30 pounds of encumberance a player has, rounded.

Weight inflicts a modifier of min(-(WEIGHT - (STRENGTH * 2 + 2)), 0) to all stats, and double that to the Speed stat. If the modifier ends up becoming positive, it's lowered to 0. So a character with a speed of +1, a strength of +1, and a weight of 1 would have no effect [-(1 - 4) = 3 -> 0] but if that character had a weight of 5, there would be a [-(5 - 4) = -1] modifier on all stats and a -2 modifier to speed. 

Despite this, weight can be used as a bonus to certain types of attacks.

## AILMENTS

Ailments can have two intensities- Minor and Major. All ailments are Minor by default, but rare items and attacks can sometimes inflict Major ailments.

* **BURN:** Deals damage each turn (2 * 3 turns / 1 * 5 turns) and lowers STR by 2. 
* **FREEZE:** Deals damage each turn (1 * 2 turns / 0 * 6 turns) and lowers SPD by 2.
* **WINDED:** Lose every other turn. Lasts for (2 / 4) turns.
* **STUN:** Lose (1/3) turns.
* **POISON:** Deals damage each turn (2 * 3 turns / 5 * 2 turns) and lowers VIT by 2.

## PROGRESSION

Dunno, honestly. Probably item-based progression.
